This is the combination of a start value and a reduce function. The reduce function takes two items and computes a reduced version. The start value `S` is a kind of \"zero\" or \"identity\" value that may be intermingled as needed; idealy, `reduce(S, X)` for any item `X` yields `X`.Example: to sum up the values, use a `start_value` of `0` and a reduce function of `reduce(a, b) = a + b`.The order in which the reduce function will be applied is not specified. For example, the input `[ 0 1 2 ]` might be reduced in a sequential fashion:or it might be reduced in a tree-like way:etc."]]});
