initSidebarItems({"trait":[["ParallelIteratorState","The trait for types representing the internal *state* during parallelization. This basically represents a group of tasks to be done.Note that this trait is declared as an **unsafe trait**. That means that the trait is unsafe to implement. The reason is that other bits of code, such as the `collect` routine on `ParallelIterator`, rely on the `len` and `for_each` functions being accurate and correct. For example, if the `len` function reports that it will produce N items, then `for_each` *must* produce `N` items or else the resulting vector will contain uninitialized memory.This trait is not really intended to be implemented outside of the Rayon crate at this time. The precise safety requirements are kind of ill-documented for this reason (i.e., they are ill-understood)."]]});
