initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Length","A one-dimensional distance, with value represented by `T` and unit of measurement `Unit`.`T` can be any numeric type, for example a primitive type like u64 or f32.`Unit` is not used in the representation of a Length value. It is used only at compile time to ensure that a Length stored with one unit is converted explicitly before being used in an expression that requires a different unit.  It may be a type without values, such as an empty enum.You can multiply a Length by a `scale_factor::ScaleFactor` to convert it from one unit to another.  See the ScaleFactor docs for an example."]]});
